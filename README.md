## My process

So i first of all started by first of all arranging the HTML syntax, so as to structure my work and make it easier for building.
Then i built the container, and aligned itself and the contents within it to the center of the page.
Then i did a building from the head down, so which means from the first picture, down to the last picture and its text.
After all those were done, i styled the border, to have like that 3d feel.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- google fonts (for the fonts-family, and styles)


### What I learned

I had no idea that 'border' could be used the way it was used in this challenge, and it's same way i used it.
So i'm just very Proud of myself for being able to build and style this page.


The CSS code i'm Proud of;
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    border: 2px solid $black;
    border-right-width: 7px;
}
```


### Continued development

So i'm just going to continue taking more frontend challenges. 
They are really helpful, engaging, and interesting!.
I really do have a nice time when i'm working on a challenge, and this one was an eye-opener to me.

### Useful resources
Honestely, i didn't have any resource to help out, i did it all on my own, and it was worth it, it made it feel more of a challenge
